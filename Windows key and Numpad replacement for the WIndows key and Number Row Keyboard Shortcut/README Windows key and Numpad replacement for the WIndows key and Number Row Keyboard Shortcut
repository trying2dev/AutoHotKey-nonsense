Premise: Windows has a keyboard shortcut: the Windows key & a number from the row number. This lets you open, bring up, or minimize the associated application on the taskbar. For example, if you have Steam, Firefox, Word, and Photoshop on your taskbar, and you use Windows key and the number 3 from the number row, you will open Word. If Word is open, you will minimize it, and if Word is minimized, you will bring it up. Note: you will not maximize Word. If you snapped Word to the upper left of your screen, hitting its keyboard shortcut will only dock it or bring it up, but not change its position on your screen. Use the Windows key and arrow keys for that.

Problem: you want to use the keyboard shortcut as stated above, but you are an accountant, or you work in an environment where you make more use of the numpad than the number row -- you work in a call center for example. But you find it troubling to have to move your hands to the right position on the keyboard just to make a quick adjustment. 

Solution: my Auto Hotkey Script! It is an amazingly simple AHK script, and it only requires that your numpad be turned on, but if you are looking for a solution like this, then you most likely already have your num lock on. All my script does is interpret a Windows key, and a number from the numpad, as if you were pressing the Windows key, and a number from the number row. Keeping with the example above, if you were to hold down the Windows key, and press number 2 from the number row, you would bring up Firefox. But with my script, you will be able to swap out the number 2 from the number row for the number 2 from the numpad to achieve the same result!
