PREMISE 
Windows has a group of keyboard shortcuts: the Windows key and a number from the number row. This lets you open, bring forward, or minimize the associated application on the taskbar. For example, if you have Steam, Firefox, Word, and Photoshop on your taskbar, and you use Windows key and the number 3 from the number row, you will open Word. If Steam is in the foreground, and you use the Windows key in combination with the number one from the number row, you will minimize it. If Firefox is minimized, and you use the Windows key in combination with teh number two from the number row, you will bring it to the foreground. Keep in mind: this waill not maximize a program if it is already maximized. If you snapped Word to the upper left of your screen, hitting its keyboard shortcut will only minimize it or foreground it, but not change its position on your screen. Use the Windows key and arrow keys for that.

PROBLEM
What if you you want to use these keyboard shortcuts, but for whatever reason its a bother to use the number row -- maybe you're an accountant, you work in a call center, or you just plain ol' don't want to use it?

SOLUTION
My Auto Hotkey Script! It is an amazingly simple AHK script, and it only requires that your numpad be turned on, but if you're looking for a solution like this, then you most likely already have your num lock on. All my script does is interpret the Windows key, along with a number from the numpad, as if you were using the Windows key with a number from the number row.
